## Objectives of the App
The objective of the app is to raise user awareness of global happenings and test how conscious of global news a  user is.

## Functionality of the App
The App has a user friendly and easy to use layout, a header that displays the name of the app, an intro text that tells a user what the app does
and slides of 10 questions that comes one after the other as the user progress.
The app also has a progress bar that tells user how far they have come in the quiz, previous and next buttons for user to move slides, and a submit button that appears at the prompt of the last questions
